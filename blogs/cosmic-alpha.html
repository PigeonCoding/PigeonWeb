        <p>
          So i tried recently the cosmic alpha on my machine and wanted to give my personal opinion on it <br>
          but first
        </p>
        <h2>-- What is Cosmic?</h2>
        <p>
          For those who have been living under a rock, recently <u><a href="https://system76.com/cosmic">cosmic
              desktop</a></u> is a new DE made by the creators of <u><a href="https://pop.system76.com/">PopOS</a></u>
          <br>
          aka <u><a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a></u> and is written from the ground up with <i>the Rust
            programming language</i> and I recently installed it on <br>
          my machine to give it a shot, and I was pretty surprised by it.
        </p>
        <h2>-- The Good</h2>
        <p>
          The Cosmic DE is in my opinion pretty nice looking, i really love that style of design, and its design
          language is <br>
          pretty coherent among its set of cosmic native apps which include a text editor:
        </p>
        <img src="cosmic/text-alpha1.png" width="682" class="txt-img">
        <p>a terminal which i have currently set as my default terminal btw :) :</p>
        <img src="cosmic/terminal-alpha1.png" width="682" class="txt-img">
        <p>a files app:</p>
        <img src="cosmic/files-alpha1.png" width="682" class="txt-img">
        <p>an app store:</p>
        <img src="cosmic/appstore-alpha1.png" width="682" class="txt-img">
        <p>and a screenshot utility</p>
        <p>
          while the number of apps is not that great -- compared to kde or gnome's ecosystem since it is an alpha after
          all -- <br>
          it is still enough for basic use of the desktop without relying on other third party apps. The Desktop in
          itself is rather nice <br>
          and while some animations are missing like for going in and out of the overview as well as some interactions
          being <br>
          somewhat buggy it is rather stable and in the short while that I have used it, the DE has not crashed once
          which is a feat in <br>
          itself however I have had the cosmic settings app crash a few times on me while i was messing with the
          settings but I'll let it slide since tis is an alpha and will get fixed before the stable release
